## :exclamation: Forking this repo (Important) ##
You can use the code of this repository if you want, but I would appreciate if you attribute me as the original creator instead of blatantly copying my work. It's disrespectful since it took a lot of effort and time to build this.

I am a strong supporter of code being open source since it helps, encourages and empowers developers but plagiarism is bad and very bad if you don't give proper credits. 

I recommend that you link my GitHub account, or write my GitHub username or proper name at the bottom of your site or footer if you have designed one.
