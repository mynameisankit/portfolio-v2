##### Why have this site? #####
<Blockquote>The more we share the more we have</Blockquote>

I believe noting down and sharing is the best way to learn! So I created this blog, where I keep things that I learned, find useful, and necessary to save for later. Plus I wanted a piece of web to showcase myself since we all appreciate creativity and nicely crafted experiences.

It would be highly appreciated if I could read your comment or hear your thoughts on what I wrote.
